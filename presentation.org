* Introduction

** Health insurance
- healthcare costs increase in all developed countries
- health insurance can cause moral hazard
- oop payments is one way to mitigate this
- if a deductible increase reduces expenditure, we view this as welfare enhancing
  - trade off: risk aversion
- what if oop cause people to postpone /valuable/ treatments?
- can we identify this effect across countries?

** Health effects
- postponing/forgoing valuable care has health effects
- measuring health effects is not easy
- we use mortality per NUTS 2 region/year/age/gender in European countries
- fixed effects to control for non-observed variables

** Insurance generosity
- comparing insurance generosity across countries is not straightforward
- how to compare a system with high deductible but low coinsurance rate or many treatments exempted from oop with a low deductible system?
- we use variable =OOP=: % oop in total health expenditure in a country
- high oop is especially problematic for people on low income
- they could forgo valuable treatment if it is expensive
- if this mechanism exists: higher mortality in regions where =OOP= $\times$ =Poverty= is high

** NUTS 2 regions in Europe

** Literature: individual level data
- recent literature on relation oop and mortality
- US individual level data
- e.g. Miller et al. (2021) on Medicaid eligibility expansion:
  - introduced in different states at different times
- Chandra et al. (2021) Medicare part D prescription drug coverage
  - enrollment month
- behavioral hazard: Baicker et al. (2015)

** This paper

- European regional data
- more broad brush: cannot capture effect of 1% increase in deductible
- compare health insurance systems that are more/less generous
- more variation in =OOP= than with Dutch individual level data
- European health insurance more homogeneous across regions in a country

* Two equations to estimate

** theory

- using a theoretical model we derive two equations to be estimated:
  - probability of death as a function of =Unmet= medical needs
  - probability that someone forgoes treatment because it is too expensive as a function of =OOP= and =Poverty=

** Number of deaths
- per age, gender, year, nuts 2 region
- $k$ deaths out of $n$ population: $\binom{n}{k} m^{k}(1-m)^{n-k}$
$$
m_{ga2t} = \frac{e^{\beta_{ag}}}{1+e^{\beta_{ag}}} e^{\left( \mu_2 + \gamma \ln \left(\frac{m_{a-1,g,2,t-1}}{\bar{m}_{a-1,g}}\right)+ \beta_{poverty}\text{Poverty}_{2t} + \beta_{unmet}\text{Unmet}_{2t}\right)}
$$

** Too expensive

- one motivation for unmet medical needs is that treatment is too expensive
- fraction of people in a region indicating that they postponed/forgone treatment because it was too expensive:
$$
\text{TooExp}_{2t} = b_{0,2} + b_{0,t} + \text{OOP}_{ct} \bar{x}_{ct} \left(  b_{oop,c} + b_{interaction,c} \text{Poverty}_{2t} \right)
$$
- equation is derived by varying co-insurance and deductible

* Estimation

** Estimation technique

- Bayesian analysis: are we 95% sure that the following chain of effects is present:
  - higher oop leads to higher unmet needs in areas with high poverty
  - which then leads to higher mortality

| Alzheimer disease                                      |    13.08 |


** Robustness analysis

- include voluntary health insurance payments in =OOP= measure
- at risk of poverty as poverty measure
- separate effect of TooExp and other unmet medical needs on mortality



* Conclusions

** Policy implications
- increasing oop leads to more costs than just risk aversion
- doing without oop is not an option:
  - means tested oop
  - let copayments vary with cost effectiveness of treatments
